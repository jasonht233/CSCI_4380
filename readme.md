for our load_data:
1. We need use the schema.sql to set up the table and schema(include in the python code)
2. Then it would load four files separately.



General interface:
    #just a infinite loop to continue

    menu:
        at first, we would ask the user to write the location
        
        then get into the manu:
            *1. recommand (randomly choose the closest places for user)
                #the following 4 would be choose the closest place which the user is most interested in 
            2. Historic
            3. Outdoor
            4. Liquor
            5. Rivers
            (2-5, Find out the closest places you want)

            *6. __2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6__(#) 
                # "#" is the number k, we can choose the place in k distance
            *7. __2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6__(#th)
                # "#" is the number of k, we can choose the kth closest places

            8. we allow two or three location search like : 
                Historic Outdoor------> Example a 
                Liquor Rivers
                Outdoor Liquor

                first we would search the first closest destination for Example a is Historic Place and then we would use the place of historic place to search the closest outdoor places 
            
            *9. connect the outdoor and the fisihing, maybe we can search that if the outdoor can fish, when and where and what kind of fish can get. 



Problem to solve:

    1. all the information for the user haven't been set up. Now we get the id, but we are not sure what's kind of information would be. 

    2. for two or three or more place to find together is not finished.

    3. Can we think one more hard (complex) problem ???
